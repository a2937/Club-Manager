     * In the foregoing description, the notation

     * <i>signum</i> function, which is defined to return one of <tt>-1</tt>,

     * -sgn(compare(y, x))</tt> for all <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>.  (This
     * implies that <tt>compare(x, y)</tt> must throw an exception if and only
     * if <tt>compare(y, x)</tt> throws an exception.)<p>
     * <p>
     * The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive:
     * <tt>((compare(x, y)&gt;0) &amp;&amp; (compare(y, z)&gt;0))</tt> implies
     * <tt>compare(x, z)&gt;0</tt>.<p>

     * this fact.  The recommended language is "Note: this comparator

     * @throws ClassCastException   if the arguments' types prevent them from
